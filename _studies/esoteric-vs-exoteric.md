title: Esoteric vs. Exoteric Truths
subtitle: Milk and Meat — Why Jesus Spoke in Parables
tags: [discipleship, parables, maturity]

**Exoteric** means *outer* — public stories and practices for everyone. **Esoteric** means *inner* — depth grown by discipline and discernment.

### How Jesus taught
- Parables to the crowds (Matthew 13)
- Private explanations to disciples

### Paul’s “milk and meat” (1 Cor 3:2)
Depth is not elitism; it’s responsibility. Teaching must match maturity.

**Pattern:** outer form → inner understanding → embodied wisdom.
