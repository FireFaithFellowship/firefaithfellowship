Jesus warned against religious rank and titles that stand between the person and God:

> “You are not to be called Rabbi, for you have one teacher…  
> Call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father…  
> The greatest among you shall be your servant.” (Matthew 23:8–12)

**Why it matters:** Concentrated authority invites infiltration and abuse. Distributed responsibility protects dignity and truth.

**Practice:** Lead by serving. Titles don’t make character; habits do.
